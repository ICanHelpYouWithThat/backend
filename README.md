### What we are...
A simple site which allows people who are logged in through Facebook to find tasks that help out an organization who needs a skill they can offer - location/time constraints are matching.

We will have a simple UI Allow users once logged in as either an individual or organization. Individual User Create their profile - skills, contact info, privacy settings, skills they can offer, location, find tasks that they can signup for

Organization User Create events that require skills at a location for a certain timeframe, give Karma points to people who have completed tasks

Simple UI with a few screens that have simple forms to enter in data
